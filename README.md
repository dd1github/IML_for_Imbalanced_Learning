# XAI_for_Imbalanced_Learning

![Framework](/framework1.png)

This repository is for the paper, "eXplainable AI for Imbalanced Data."
It contains the code and links to obtain pre-trained models, as well as the steps, to reproduce several of the visualizations listed in the paper.
## Steps
1. Extract FE from a trained model.
  - We provide 2 illustrations for this:
    - CIFAR-10, which uses Pytorch datasets
    - INaturalist, which uses image folders
  - INaturalist: start with Extract_FE_INat.py
